This app will update your Twitter profile when you're online in Discord automatically.

actually, this project was for my own laziness to notify my friends on Twitter when I'm in Among Us to come and play with each other. ðŸ˜‰

```
git clone https://github.com/mohsenbostan/among-go.git

Hurray! now you are running the application successfully. ðŸ¥³
